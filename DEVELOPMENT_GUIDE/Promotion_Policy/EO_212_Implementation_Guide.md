# Executive Order No. 212 (1939) Implementation Guide
## Promotion Algorithm for Prescriptive Analytics System

---

## **DOCUMENT OVERVIEW**

**Title:** Executive Order No. 212  
**Date Issued:** July 6, 1939  
**Issued By:** President Manuel L. Quezon  
**Subject:** Regulations Governing Seniority, Promotion, and Separation from the Service, of Officers of the Reserve Force, Philippine Army

**Purpose:** This document establishes the official rules and requirements for promotion eligibility of reserve officers in the Philippine Army Reserve Force.

---

## **I. SENIORITY RULES**

### **Key Principles:**

1. **Precedence**
   - Regular officers take precedence over reserve officers of the same grade
   
2. **Seniority List Management**
   - All Reserve Force officers are carried on an official seniority list
   - List must be approved by the President
   - Establishes permanent relative seniority of officers
   - Officers promoted to a new grade are placed at the bottom of that grade
   - Seniority within a grade is based on **total length of active service**

3. **Loss of Seniority**
   - Officers may lose seniority due to court-martial sentences

4. **List Updates**
   - Chief of Staff maintains the seniority list
   - Updates made for: separations, appointments, loss of rank, and other changes
   - Published to the Army at least **once per year**

---

## **II. PROMOTION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Basic Requirements (All 5 Must Be Fulfilled)**

According to Section 4 of EO 212, every recommendation for promotion must show that **ALL FIVE** of the following conditions are met:

#### **(a) Certificate of Capacity**
- Must hold a certificate of capacity for the next higher grade
- Indicates satisfactory completion of specified correspondence courses
- Courses prescribed by the Chief of Staff

**System Implementation:**
- Database field: `certificate_of_capacity` (Boolean)
- Validation: Check if reservist has completed required correspondence courses
- Status: PASS/FAIL

---

#### **(b) Appropriate Vacancy**
- Must be an appropriate vacancy under the peacetime procurement objective
- Vacancy must exist for the target promotion rank

**System Implementation:**
- Database field: `vacancy_available` (Boolean)
- Check against organizational structure and authorized positions
- Real-time vacancy tracking by rank and company
- Status: AVAILABLE/NOT AVAILABLE

---

#### **(c) Minimum Time in Grade**

**Required Service Time by Rank:**

| Current Rank | Minimum Years in Grade | Next Rank |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Third Lieutenant | 2 years | Second Lieutenant |
| Second Lieutenant | 3 years | First Lieutenant |
| First Lieutenant | 4 years | Captain |
| Captain | 5 years | Major |
| Major | 6 years | Lieutenant Colonel |
| Lieutenant Colonel | 7 years | Colonel |

**Important Notes:**
- Service time in Officers' Reserve Corps (United States Army) counts
- Service time in Philippine Constabulary counts
- Service time in Philippine Army counts
- All commissioned service is credited when computing length of service

**System Implementation:**
- Database fields:
  - `current_rank` (String)
  - `date_of_rank` (Date)
  - `years_in_grade` (Calculated field)
  - `commissioned_service_history` (Array of service records)
- Calculation:
  ```
  years_in_grade = (current_date - date_of_rank) / 365.25
  total_service = sum(all_commissioned_service)
  ```
- Status: QUALIFIED/NOT QUALIFIED
- Display: "X years of Y years required"

---

#### **(d) Educational Courses**
- Must have completed prescribed correspondence or other educational courses
- Courses prescribed by Chief of Staff for their arm/service and grade
- Courses are specific to the officer's branch and target rank

**System Implementation:**
- Database field: `educational_courses_completed` (Array)
- Required courses by rank and branch
- Track completion dates and certificates
- Status: COMPLETED/INCOMPLETE

---

#### **(e) Active Duty Training & Efficiency Report**
- Must have completed at least **21 days of active duty training** during service in current grade
- Must have received an efficiency report (P.A. Form No. 13A)
- Efficiency rating must be at least **"Satisfactory"**

**Special Provisions:**
- Reserve officers called to extended active duty (6 months or more) are promoted like Regular Army officers
- Still subject to minimum time in grade requirements (section 4c)

**System Implementation:**
- Database fields:
  - `active_duty_days` (Integer)
  - `efficiency_rating` (String: "Excellent", "Satisfactory", "Unsatisfactory")
  - `efficiency_report_form` (Document reference)
- Validation:
  - active_duty_days >= 21
  - efficiency_rating >= "Satisfactory"
- Status: QUALIFIED/NOT QUALIFIED

  const rank_date = new Date(date_of_rank);
  const milliseconds_diff = current_date - rank_date;
  const years = milliseconds_diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25);
  return years.toFixed(2);
}
```

### **Total Commissioned Service Calculation**
```javascript
function calculateTotalCommissionedService(service_history) {
  let total_years = 0;
  
  service_history.forEach(service => {
    const start = new Date(service.start_date);
    const end = service.end_date ? new Date(service.end_date) : new Date();
    const years = (end - start) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25);
    total_years += years;
  });
  
  return total_years.toFixed(2);
}
```

### **Eligibility Score Calculation**
```javascript
function calculateEligibilityScore(reservist) {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Criterion (a): Certificate of Capacity - 20 points
  if (reservist.certificate_of_capacity.has_certificate) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Criterion (b): Vacancy Available - 20 points
  if (reservist.vacancy_status.is_vacancy_available) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Criterion (c): Time in Grade - 20 points
  const required_years = RANK_REQUIREMENTS[reservist.current_rank].years;
  if (reservist.current_rank_details.years_in_grade >= required_years) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Criterion (d): Educational Courses - 20 points
  if (reservist.educational_requirements.is_qualified) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Criterion (e): Active Duty & Efficiency - 20 points
  const has_21_days = reservist.active_duty_records.total_active_duty_days >= 21;
  const has_satisfactory = reservist.active_duty_records.current_efficiency_rating !== "Unsatisfactory";
  if (has_21_days && has_satisfactory) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  return score;
}
```

### **Promotion Priority Ranking**
```javascript
function calculatePriorityScore(reservist) {
  let priority = 0;
  
  // Factor 1: Years of total service (40% weight)
  priority += (reservist.seniority_data.total_commissioned_service * 4);
  
  // Factor 2: Efficiency rating (30% weight)
  const efficiency_scores = {
    "Excellent": 30,
    "Satisfactory": 20,
    "Unsatisfactory": 0
  };
  priority += efficiency_scores[reservist.active_duty_records.current_efficiency_rating];
  
  // Factor 3: Training completion rate (20% weight)
  priority += (reservist.educational_requirements.completion_percentage * 0.2);
  
  // Factor 4: Active duty days above minimum (10% weight)
  const extra_days = Math.max(0, reservist.active_duty_records.total_active_duty_days - 21);
  priority += (extra_days * 0.5);
  
  return Math.round(priority);
}
```

## **SUMMARY**

This implementation guide provides a complete framework for building the prescriptive analytics promotion algorithm based on Executive Order No. 212 (1939). The system must:

✅ **Evaluate all 5 mandatory criteria**
✅ **Assign equal weight (20 points each)**
✅ **Require 100% score for full eligibility**
✅ **Track partial qualification (60%+) for development**
✅ **Generate actionable recommendations**
✅ **Provide gap analysis and development plans**
✅ **Maintain audit trails and compliance**
✅ **Achieve 80%+ accuracy validated by experts**

The algorithm transforms a manual, paper-based promotion evaluation process into an automated, data-driven system that ensures fair, compliant, and transparent promotion recommendations for the 301st Ready Reserve Infantry Battalion.
