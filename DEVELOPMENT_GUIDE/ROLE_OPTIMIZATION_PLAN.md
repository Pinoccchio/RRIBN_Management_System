# Role-Based Dashboard Optimization Plan

> **Last Updated:** October 2025
> **Status:** Planning Phase
> **Purpose:** Comprehensive role restructuring based on updated requirements

---

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **Critical Changes:**
1. ✅ **Super Admin is HIDDEN/SECRET** - System architect, not public-facing
2. ✅ **Administrator creates COMPANIES** - Public authority (was Super Admin)
3. ✅ **Administrator creates STAFF** - Already correct
4. ✅ **ANALYTICS DISTRIBUTION (UPDATED):**
   - **Super Admin** = System-Wide Analytics (monitoring & configuration) - **EXCLUSIVE**
   - **Administrator** = Prescriptive Analytics (AI-powered promotion recommendations) - **EXCLUSIVE**
   - **Staff** = NO ANALYTICS

### **Why These Changes:**
- Super Admin = Backend system architect (monitors system, configures requirements)
- Administrator = Public battalion authority (makes promotion decisions with AI recommendations)
- Staff = Company manager (operational tasks only, NO analytics)

---

## 🏢 **COMPANY MANAGEMENT (MOVED TO ADMINISTRATOR)**

### **Why Administrator Should Create Companies:**

1. **Public-Facing Authority** - Administrator is the visible decision-maker
2. **Organizational Structure** - Companies are administrative units
3. **Staff Assignment** - Admin creates companies → assigns Staff → Staff manages reservists
4. **Real-World Alignment** - Battalion commanders create company structures
5. **Super Admin is Hidden** - Users shouldn't know Super Admin exists

### **Company Management Workflow:**

```
ADMINISTRATOR (Public-Facing):
├─ Creates Company "ALPHA"
├─ Creates Company "BRAVO"
├─ Creates Company "CHARLIE"
├─ Edits company details (name, description)
├─ Activates/Deactivates companies
└─ Assigns Staff to each company

STAFF (Company Manager):
├─ Manages reservists in assigned company
├─ Creates trainings for assigned company
└─ Cannot create companies (Admin does this)

SUPER ADMIN (Hidden):
├─ Monitors company creation (read-only)
├─ Can override if needed (emergency only)
└─ NOT visible to users
```

### **Company Management Features (Administrator):**

#### **Create Company:**
- Company Code (e.g., ALPHA, BRAVO, CHARLIE)
- Company Name (e.g., Alpha Company, Bravo Company)
- Description
- Status (Active/Inactive)

#### **Edit Company:**
- Update name, description
- Change status

#### **Deactivate Company:**
- Soft delete (mark as inactive)
- Reassign reservists if needed

#### **Reactivate Company:**
- Restore inactive company

---

## 📊 **ANALYTICS DISTRIBUTION (COMPREHENSIVE)**

### **Analytics by Role:**

| Analytics Feature | Staff | Administrator | Super Admin |
|-------------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Prescriptive Analytics (AI)** | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** | ❌ |
| **Individual Eligibility Check** | ❌ | ✅ All companies | ❌ |
| **AI Promotion Recommendations** | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** | ❌ |
| **Company Promotion Dashboard** | ❌ | ✅ All companies | ❌ |
| **Promotion Recommendations** | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** | ❌ |
| **Gap Analysis** | ❌ | ✅ Comprehensive | ❌ |
| **Rank Distribution** | ❌ | ✅ All companies | ✅ Monitor |
| **Cross-Company Comparison** | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** | ❌ |
| **Vacancy Management** | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** | ❌ |
| **Fairness Check** | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** | ❌ |
| **System-Wide Analytics** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** |
| **System Monitoring** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** |
| **Long-Term Trends** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** |
| **System Performance** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **EXCLUSIVE** |

**Summary:**
- **Staff**: ❌ **NO ANALYTICS** (operational tasks only)
- **Administrator**: ✅ **Prescriptive Analytics ONLY** (AI-powered promotion recommendations)
- **Super Admin**: ✅ **System-Wide Analytics ONLY** (monitoring & configuration)

---

### **STAFF Analytics**

**❌ NO ANALYTICS FOR STAFF**

Staff role focuses on **operational tasks only** and does NOT have access to any analytics features.

**Rationale:**
- Staff manage day-to-day operations (reservists, documents, training)
- Promotion decisions and analytics are handled by Administrator
- Keeps Staff role focused on execution, not analysis

---

### **ADMINISTRATOR Analytics (Prescriptive - AI-Powered)**

**Purpose:** Make data-driven promotion decisions using AI recommendations

#### **Features:**

1. **System-Wide Promotion Overview**
   ```

   Company CHARLIE: 7 eligible / 60 total (11.7%)

   Total Eligible: 17 reservists
   ```

2. **Individual Eligibility Checker (All Companies)**
   - Same as Staff, but can check ANY reservist

   - CPL John Doe (75/100) ⚠️ REVIEW
   ```

5. **Vacancy Management**
   ```
   Available Positions:

   Sergeant: 5 vacancies
   - Company ALPHA: 2 vacancies
   - Company BRAVO: 1 vacancy

   Eligible Candidates: 17
   ```

6. **Fairness Check**
   ```
   Promotion Standards Across Companies:

   Average Score for Promotion:
   - ALPHA: 95 points (high standard)
   - BRAVO: 85 points (lower standard)

   ⚠️ Alert: Inconsistent standards
   ```

**Access Level:**
- ✅ View ALL companies

   ```

**Access Level:**

   ├─ Manages reservists (day-to-day operations)

## 🔑 **KEY CHANGES SUMMARY**

| Feature | OLD Location | NEW Location | Reason |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Companies Management** | Super Admin | **Administrator** | Super Admin is hidden; Admin is public authority |
| **Staff Creation** | Super Admin | **Administrator** | Already correct in requirements |
| **Prescriptive Analytics** | None | **Administrator EXCLUSIVE** | AI-powered promotion decisions |

| **Super Admin Role** | Visible | **Hidden/Secret** | System architect, not public-facing |

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **After Implementation:**

1. ✅ **Super Admin is hidden** - Regular users don't know it exists
2. ✅ **Administrator can create companies** - Public authority
3. ✅ **Administrator can create staff** - Primary responsibility
4. ✅ **Staff has NO analytics** - Operational tasks only
5. ✅ **Administrator has prescriptive analytics** - AI-powered promotion decisions (EXCLUSIVE)
6. ✅ **Super Admin has system-wide analytics** - System monitoring & configuration (EXCLUSIVE)
7. ✅ **All roles have appropriate access levels** - Security enforced via RLS

---

## 📝 **NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Security:**
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies must be updated
- API permissions must reflect new role capabilities
- Audit logs must track all company creation/modifications

### **Data Migration:**
- No data migration needed (structure change only)
- Existing companies remain in database
- Only UI/API permissions change

### **User Experience:**
- Administrator gets more prominent role (as intended)
- Staff focuses on operational tasks (NO analytics)
- Super Admin becomes truly hidden (system architect)

### **Testing:**
- Test company creation by Administrator
- Test Staff has NO analytics access
- Test Administrator prescriptive analytics (AI recommendations)
- Test Super Admin system-wide analytics (monitoring)
- Test RLS policies for each role

---

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION**

This plan restructures the role-based dashboard to align with:
1. Super Admin as hidden system architect (system-wide analytics)
2. Administrator as public battalion authority (creates companies, prescriptive analytics)
3. Staff as company manager (operational tasks only, NO analytics)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Begin Phase 1 (Move Companies to Administrator)
3. Implement in sequential phases
4. Test thoroughly at each phase
